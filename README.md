# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using PyTorch

This project is a hands-on deep learning exercise completed on [Coursera](https://coursera.org/verify/RWI7WC6DOTHD).  
It focuses on using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **ResNet-18** to detect COVID-19 in chest X-ray images.

## 🧠 Overview
The goal of this project was to build and train a ResNet-18 model using PyTorch for binary image classification — detecting whether a chest X-ray shows COVID-19 or not.  
The project was completed on Coursera’s Rhyme platform with pre-configured cloud environments for Python, Jupyter, and PyTorch.

## 📋 Project Tasks
- Create a custom **Dataset** and **DataLoader** in PyTorch  
- Apply image **transformations** and visualize data  
- Build and train a **ResNet-18** CNN  
- Evaluate model performance and visualize results
